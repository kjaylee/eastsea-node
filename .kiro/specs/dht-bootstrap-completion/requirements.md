# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on completing the DHT (Distributed Hash Table) protocol implementation and enhancing the Bootstrap system to achieve full P2P networking functionality. Currently, the project is at 85% completion with core blockchain features implemented, but critical networking components need completion to reach production readiness.

The DHT protocol completion will enable proper peer discovery and routing, while the Bootstrap system enhancement will provide reliable network entry points for new nodes. These components are essential for the decentralized network to function effectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a network node, I want to properly handle DHT ping/pong messages, so that I can maintain connectivity with other nodes and verify their availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node receives a ping message THEN the system SHALL respond with a proper pong message containing node information
2. WHEN a node receives a pong response THEN the system SHALL update the routing table with the responding node's information
3. WHEN a ping/pong exchange fails THEN the system SHALL mark the node as potentially unreachable and retry according to DHT protocol
4. WHEN handling ping messages THEN the system SHALL validate the message format and sender authenticity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a network node, I want to handle find_node requests efficiently, so that other nodes can discover peers close to specific node IDs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node receives a find_node request THEN the system SHALL return the K closest nodes from its routing table
2. WHEN processing find_node requests THEN the system SHALL validate the target node ID format
3. WHEN responding to find_node THEN the system SHALL include accurate node contact information (IP, port, node ID)
4. WHEN receiving find_node responses THEN the system SHALL update its routing table with new node information
5. WHEN the routing table is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain proper K-bucket organization

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a new node joining the network, I want the Bootstrap system to help me discover and connect to active peers, so that I can participate in the network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a node starts up THEN the system SHALL contact known bootstrap servers to get initial peer lists
2. WHEN bootstrap peer lists are received THEN the system SHALL parse and validate peer information
3. WHEN new peers are discovered THEN the system SHALL automatically attempt connections to expand the peer network
4. WHEN peer connections fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
5. WHEN bootstrap servers are unreachable THEN the system SHALL try alternative discovery methods (mDNS, UPnP)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the system to handle network interface changes gracefully, so that nodes can adapt to changing network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network interfaces change THEN the system SHALL detect the changes automatically
2. WHEN local IP addresses change THEN the system SHALL update node announcements accordingly
3. WHEN IPv6 networks are available THEN the system SHALL support dual-stack operation
4. WHEN multiple network interfaces exist THEN the system SHALL choose the most appropriate interface for peer communication

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage for networking components, so that I can verify the system works correctly under various conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DHT protocol handlers are implemented THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for each message type
2. WHEN bootstrap functionality is complete THEN the system SHALL include integration tests with mock bootstrap servers
3. WHEN network failure scenarios occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully and recover automatically
4. WHEN performance benchmarks are run THEN the system SHALL meet specified latency and throughput requirements
5. WHEN security tests are executed THEN the system SHALL resist common network attacks and validate message authenticity
