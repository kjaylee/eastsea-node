## Wallet Management

### 1. Basic Wallet Usage

Eastsea provides a built-in wallet system. Test accounts are automatically created during demo execution.

#### Account Creation Process (performed internally)

```
üîë New account created: ff7580ebeca78b5468b42e182fff7e8e820c37c3
üîë New account created: 0e56ad656c29a51263df1ca8e1a2d6169e95db51
```

#### Checking Wallet Status

```
üìã Wallet Accounts:
  1. ff7580ebeca78b5468b42e182fff7e8e820c37c3 (Balance: 1000)
  2. 0e56ad656c29a51263df1ca8e1a2d6169e95db51 (Balance: 500)
```

### 2. Token Transfer

#### Transfer Between Wallets (automatically executed in demo)

```
üí∏ Transfer: ff7580ebeca78b5468b42e182fff7e8e820c37c3 -> 0e56ad656c29a51263df1ca8e1a2d6169e95db51 (50 units)
üí∞ Wallet transfer completed
‚úçÔ∏è  Transaction signed: 00f246cc83033a6f
```

#### Transfer via API

```bash
# Create and send transaction
curl -X POST http://localhost:8545 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "sendTransaction",
    "params": {
      "from": "ff7580ebeca78b5468b42e182fff7e8e820c37c3",
      "to": "0e56ad656c29a51263df1ca8e1a2d6169e95db51",
      "amount": 100
    },
    "id": 1
  }'
```

### 3. Security Considerations

- **Private Key Security**: Keep private keys in a secure location
- **Signature Verification**: All transactions are protected by digital signatures
- **Network Security**: P2P communication verifies integrity with checksums

## FAQ

### Q1: Is Eastsea a real cryptocurrency?

A: No, Eastsea is a blockchain clone for educational and research purposes. It is not a cryptocurrency with real value.

### Q2: Is it compatible with other blockchains?

A: Eastsea is an independent blockchain and is not directly compatible with other blockchains. However, the JSON-RPC API follows standards.

### Q3: Can it be used in a production environment?

A: The current version is designed for development and testing purposes. Additional security review and optimization are needed for production use.

### Q4: Can it run on Windows?

A: Yes, Zig supports cross-platform, so it can run on Windows. However, some network features may have platform-specific differences.

### Q5: How do I create custom programs?

A: You can refer to the `src/programs/custom_program.zig` file to write new programs. See the developer guide for more details.

### Q6: Is there a limit to the number of nodes participating in the network?

A: Technically there is no limit, but the current implementation is optimized for small networks. Additional optimization is needed for large networks.

### Q7: Where is the data stored?

A: The current version uses in-memory storage. Additional implementation is needed for persistent storage.

### Q8: How does the consensus mechanism work?

A: Eastsea uses the Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism. This cryptographically proves the time sequence to achieve high throughput.

### Q9: Where can I find the API documentation?

A: You can find the complete API documentation in the `docs/API.md` file.

### Q10: How do I contribute?
